#
#   1. This run's own temp HOME -> @HOME@. Two roots, not one: mktemp hands back
#      /tmp/... while the binary may report the resolved /private/tmp/... form.
#      The longer path is substituted first so the shorter one cannot
#      half-replace a nested match and leave a prefix behind.
#
#   2. The wall-clock value of slog's `time=` attribute -> @TIMESTAMP@.
#      slog.NewTextHandler stamps every record with time.Now() in RFC3339 and
#      the binary exposes no flag to suppress it, so `dot apply --dry-run` emits
#      three log lines per profile that never match across runs. Only the VALUE
#      is masked; the `time=` key, the level, the message and every other
#      attribute are compared byte for byte, so a refactor that drops, reorders
#      or reworders a log line is still caught. Two sed expressions rather than
#      one alternation because BSD sed has no \| in a basic regex.
#
#      This is deliberately fixed here and not in tests/expected-diff.tsv. A
#      registry row for it would be a row added to turn a red build green rather
#      than to record a decision, which is precisely what that file forbids.
