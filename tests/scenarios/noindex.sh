# not branch coverage: it is whether the BUILT binary, invoked the way a user
# invokes it, marks the right directories under the home it was pointed at and
# leaves the rest alone. One invocation walks every project tree under a home
# and writes files into directories the tool does not own, so the blast radius
# of a wrong predicate is every project the user has.
#
# Portability: only POSIX `find` features are used (`-name`), unlike
# tests/scenarios/secrets.sh which needs GNU `find -printf`. That keeps this
# scenario runnable against a locally built binary as well as in the container.

#
