# Fail the build when a package carries no coverage floor, or a floor names no
# package.
#
# The floor table in .testcoverage.yml is hand-maintained; the package set it
# describes is not. That asymmetry is the whole reason this script exists. A
# package added later arrives with no floor and is measured against nothing, and
# a floor left behind after a rename sits there looking like enforcement
# forever. Both are the same set comparison read in opposite directions.
#
# The parsing below is grep- and awk-shaped rather than a real YAML parse, which
# makes it brittle by construction: a reformat of the config can stop it seeing
# entries it used to see. That is a deliberate trade, and the emptiness guard is
# what pays for it. Every gate in this repository that quietly broke, broke by
# having nothing to check and reporting success -- the govulncheck gate's own
# scenario header records that history. So this script refuses to reach a
# verdict on empty inputs, and prints what it examined before it reports
# anything, which converts brittleness into a loud failure instead of a silent
# pass.
#
# It reads `go list` and the config, and nothing else. It deliberately reads no
# coverage profile: whether a package is MEASURABLE is the threshold checker's
# question and it already answers it (a package with no tests reports 0.0% and
# fails its floor, it does not vanish). This script only asks whether the table
# and the tree still describe the same set of packages.

#
# Both checks run on the RAW entries, before normalisation erases the very thing
# they inspect. Each closes a way for this table to look seeded while enforcing
# nothing, and both were found by review on PR #87 rather than by design:
#
#   - An entry with a `path` but no `threshold` is not an error to the coverage
#     tool. It falls back to `threshold.package`; the policy keeps that default
#     positive and rejects the malformed entry locally, so neither layer can
#     quietly treat a missing package floor as enforcement.
#   - An override path missing its trailing `$` still normalises to a live
#     package name here, so this script blesses it, while the coverage tool's
#     FIRST matching override wins and shadows the sibling's own entry.
#     Reproduced: unanchoring `^internal/config` judged `internal/config/catalog`
#     at config's floor instead of its own.
#
# Neither is caught by the set comparison below, which sees only the normalised
# name and cannot tell a complete entry from a hollow one.
