//  1. read the raw bytes UNLOCKED and hash them (a missing or empty file is

//  2. parse through the same code path Read uses, so invalid JSON still
//     fails hard with ErrInvalidJSON and dot never overwrites a file it
//     cannot faithfully rewrite;
//  3. apply fn. ErrNoChange returns (false, nil) IMMEDIATELY — on the first
//     pass that is before any lock acquire, so a no-op mutation creates
//     neither ~/.claude nor the lock directory; any other closure error is
//     returned with nothing written;
//  4. marshal with two-space indentation and a trailing newline;
//  5. acquire the PID lock at LockDir, once. The retry keeps holding it;
//  6. re-read and re-hash under the lock. A different hash means another
//     writer landed inside the window: discard the marshaled document and
//     go around from step 1 without releasing the lock, so fn is re-applied
//     to the foreign writer's content instead of clobbering it. A second
//     mismatch is an error naming the path;
//  7. persist with fileutil.EnsureFileAtomic at mode 0644 — hash-skip when
//     unchanged, backup-before-overwrite, dry-run aware through the runner,
//     and a temp-and-rename write, so an interrupted write leaves the
//     original intact and a symlink at the path is refused rather than
//     written through. It returns that call's changed flag.
//
// The lock is released on every exit path: the release is deferred as soon
// as it exists, so a marshal failure, a re-read failure, a declining retry
// and a write failure all drop it.
//
// ponytail: known ceiling, and a residual on purpose rather than a race
// claimed closed. Step 6's re-hash happens BEFORE EnsureFileAtomic, which
// then does its own read, a backup, a MkdirAll and only then the rename. A
// foreign write landing inside that final sub-interval is still lost. It is
// far smaller than the read-to-write window this restructure closes, but it
// is not zero, and the lock binds only dot. Closing it needs a
// compare-and-swap write: move the hash check inside Runner.WriteFileAtomic,
// between its temp-file write and its rename.
