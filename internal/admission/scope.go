// Package admission implements the repository-scoped heavy-job admission
// controller: one heavy slot per project repo (shared across its worktrees,
// branches, sessions, and subagents), one host-wide maintenance slot, and a
// host-pressure gate that defers new heavy work while the machine is under
// memory, thermal, CPU, or WindowServer stress. The mechanism is deferral,
// never termination: the controller blocks NEW work and reports the owner of
// the running one. All platform differences are runtime GOOS switches (never
// build tags) and every decision is a pure function with an injected clock,
// so the whole decision surface is testable on Linux.
