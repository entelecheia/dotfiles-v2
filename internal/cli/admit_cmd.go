		Long: `Admit a heavy job (build, full test run, indexing, bulk copy, dependency
update) through the resource-admission controller. The gate defers while the
host shows memory pressure warning/critical, verifiable thermal pressure, a
WindowServer watchdog termination inside its grace window, or CPU/load
saturation sustained past the policy thresholds; recovery requires five
continuous minutes of normal telemetry. One heavy slot is held per project
repo (shared across its worktrees, branches, and sessions); different repos
run in parallel. --class maintenance takes the single host-wide maintenance
slot instead. On defer the exit code is 75 (EX_TEMPFAIL) with a
machine-readable outcome on stdout when --json is set. When a command runs,
its own stdout is the payload and the --json completion record goes to
stderr, so the exit code is the machine-readable result. 'dot ai run' and
the tooling updates share these slots. Heavy work launched outside both
holds no lease; a bounded process-table scan defers when such work runs in
this repo or its repo is unknown. Use '--' before commands that collide with
subcommand names.`,
