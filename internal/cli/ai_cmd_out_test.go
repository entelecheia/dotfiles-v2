// TestNewAgentsManagerFromCmd_CarriesCommandWriter closes the gap between the
// SEAM-01 carrier and its production caller. AgentsManager.Out exists so that
// authorInteractive's prompts and progress lines follow the command's writer,
// but the seam is inert until the constructor site assigns it: a nil Out
// resolves to os.Stdout, so a caller that redirects cobra's output (a test
// buffer, an embedding caller) silently loses every one of those lines.
//
// newAgentsManagerFromCmd is the single construction choke point for all
// twelve `dot ai` call sites, so asserting here covers them all. Deleting the
// mgr.Out assignment must turn this test red.
