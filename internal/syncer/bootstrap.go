// BootstrapOptions carries everything the sync and peer command trees used to
// read off a *cobra.Command before doing any work. Flag translation stays in
// cli; loading the user state, resolving the profile and constructing the
// runner are the engine's.
//
// The fields are deliberately the flags themselves rather than resolved
// objects: a caller with no cobra command (a scheduled run, a test) can fill
// the same struct without inventing a flag set.
type BootstrapOptions struct {
	// Profile names the sync store to resolve. Empty means the default
	// profile, matching the `--profile` flag's own default.
	Profile string

	// ReadOnly resolves the profile without creating the local store,
	// migrating global config, or healing .gitignore. It is a separate field
	// from DryRun on purpose: `dot peer status` is read-only with a live
	// runner, and `dot sync status --dry-run` is both.
	ReadOnly bool

	// DryRun reaches BOTH the runner and config resolution: it selects the
	// read-only resolver alongside ReadOnly, because a preview that creates the
	// per-workspace store has already written before the runner sees anything.
	// The fields stay separate because their meanings do: `dot peer status` is
	// read-only with a live runner.
	DryRun bool

	// Verbose becomes Config.Verbose, which turns rsync's output on.
	Verbose bool

	// FilterMode overrides the resolved profile's filter mode for this run,
	// but only when FilterModeSet is true. It is the raw flag string rather
	// than a parsed FilterMode so the parse error keeps its `--filter-mode:`
	// wording on this side of the seam.
	FilterMode    string
	FilterModeSet bool

	// Home is the raw --home override, empty for the process home. It reaches
	// state loading and profile resolution together: a run pointed at another
	// user's home must read that user's state file and resolve that user's
	// workspace paths, never the invoking user's (BUG-07).
	Home string

// BootstrapResult is what every sync and peer subcommand needs before it can
// do anything: the loaded user state, the resolved profile config, and the
// runner external commands go through.
//
// Runner covers command execution only, and its DryRun flag suppresses only
// that. It is NOT a blanket dry-run guarantee: engine entries that mutate files
// directly — PeerInit via SaveLocalConfig, PeerSchedule via os.MkdirAll and
// os.WriteFile — bypass it entirely, so each of those carries its own dry-run
// arm and returns a flag the caller renders. A caller must not read a dry-run
// runner as "nothing was written".
//
// Profile resolution is no longer among the things that slip past it: Bootstrap
// takes the read-only resolver under DryRun.
