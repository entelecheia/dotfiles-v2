## dot guard

Claude Code safety hooks (careful warnings + freeze boundary)

### Synopsis

Manage dot-owned Claude Code PreToolUse safety hooks.

careful warns before destructive shell commands (rm -rf, DROP TABLE,
git push --force, ...). freeze denies Edit/Write outside a chosen
directory. Hooks live in ~/.claude/settings.json, tagged with a
"# dot-guard" marker; entries owned by other tools are never touched.

Guard is a guardrail, not a sandbox: careful only inspects the Bash
tool, and freeze cannot stop shell writes (sed, tee, ...). Temp dirs
and ~/.claude/plans stay writable while frozen.

```
dot guard [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for guard
