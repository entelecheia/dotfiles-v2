## dot admit status

Show admission owners, pressure evidence, and hysteresis state

### Synopsis

Report the resource-admission controller's view: active slot owners
(scope, class, owner, pid, cwd, since), the host-pressure evidence with
per-probe availability, the last WindowServer watchdog evidence, and the
hysteresis countdown when a defer episode is recovering. The evaluation is
read-only: status never advances or resets the recovery window. Jobs not
launched via 'dot admit' are not visible to the controller.
