## dot update

Update dot binary to latest version

### Synopsis

Download and install the latest dot release from GitHub.

A Homebrew install is upgraded through the brew that owns it instead: when the
installed tap recipe matches the verified native release, dot uses its bounded
prebuilt update policy. Stale or changed tap metadata uses the full maintenance
gate before brew update. A pinned formula is left alone. Use --homebrew to
target an existing Homebrew install from a standalone dot binary. --check only
reports the latest version.

```
dot update [flags]
```

### Options

```
      --check      Only check for updates without installing
  -h, --help       help for update
