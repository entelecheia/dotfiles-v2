## dot ai memory sync

Replicate the claude-mem store with a peer over ssh

### Synopsis

Replicate observations, session summaries, and their sdk_sessions rows
with a peer Mac. Incremental by default (receiver's MAX(created_at) minus a
7-day overlap); --full re-offers everything and dedupe absorbs it. The peer
needs only the dot binary: the transport is
'ssh <target> dot ai memory sync --serve <op>' with JSON over stdio.

sessions replicates all sessions both ways. status prints both sides'
counts plus the last scheduled run. With no action, sync runs both
directions. --peer defaults to the configured dot peer target.
