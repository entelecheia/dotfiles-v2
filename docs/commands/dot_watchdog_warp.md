## dot watchdog warp

Run one WARP self-heal pass (the root daemon invokes this)

### Synopsis

Probe WARP health (warp-cli Connected AND an interface address in
100.96.0.0/12), fold it into the consecutive-failure state, and act: after
fail_threshold consecutive failures, warp-cli disconnect/connect, up to 3
attempts; then launchctl kickstart -k the WARP daemon, rate-limited to one
restart per 30 minutes. Every action is logged and notified.

```
