## dot restore

One-stop interactive restore (profile, apps, AI, secrets)

### Synopsis

Restore everything dot manages from a shared backup root in one run.

The wizard confirms the backup root, picks the source host (any machine
that backed up into the same root — cross-host restore), selects domains
and snapshot versions, optionally runs 'dot apply' after the profile
restore (installs packages including age), then restores secrets, app
settings, and AI settings in a safe order. Existing local files are
preserved in pre-restore backup locations that each step reports.

Order: profile → state reload → apply (optional) → secrets → apps → ai.
A profile restore failure aborts the wizard (later steps depend on the
restored state); any other failure is recorded and the run continues.
--version pins both the profile and AI snapshot; use the individual
commands (dot profile restore / dot ai restore) to mix versions.
