## dot admit

Run one heavy job per repo behind the host-pressure gate

### Synopsis

Admit a heavy job (build, full test run, indexing, bulk copy, dependency
update) through the resource-admission controller. The gate defers while the
host shows memory pressure warning/critical, verifiable thermal pressure, a
WindowServer watchdog termination inside its grace window, or CPU/load
saturation sustained past the policy thresholds; recovery requires five
continuous minutes of normal telemetry. One heavy slot is held per project
repo (shared across its worktrees, branches, and sessions); different repos
run in parallel. --class maintenance takes the single host-wide maintenance
slot instead. On defer the exit code is 75 (EX_TEMPFAIL) with a
machine-readable outcome when --json is set. Jobs launched without
'dot admit' are not visible to the controller. Use '--' before commands that
collide with subcommand names.

```
dot admit [--class heavy|maintenance] [--wait 30m] [--json] -- <command> [args...] [flags]
```

### Options

```
      --class string    slot class: heavy (per-repo) or maintenance (host-wide) (default "heavy")
  -h, --help            help for admit
      --json            print the outcome as JSON
      --wait duration   maximum time to wait for the slot before deferring (default 30m0s)
```
