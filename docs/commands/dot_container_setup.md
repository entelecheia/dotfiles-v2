## dot container setup

Install the backend and write the container shim

### Synopsis

Set up the container command on this host: install the backend and write
the shim and its state file, then enable the container module in user state
and render the shim's PATH entry (the shell module). Afterwards it is
equivalent to dot apply --module container. A host the module cannot set up
keeps its config and shell files untouched.

The opt-in in user state syncs to your other machines, but each host chooses
for itself: running setup is this host's yes, and it overrides an earlier no.

On Linux an existing, usable docker is used as is. With no docker or podman,
setup offers to install the distro docker package (--yes accepts) and falls
back to podman when declined or when the docker install fails.
