## dot peer setup

Install or remove the periodic peer sync job

### Synopsis

Schedule dot peer sync.

An unreachable peer exits 0, so a laptop that is away simply produces quiet
no-op runs rather than failures. That is why this can be scheduled at all.

Pick an interval in minutes, not seconds: the payload is large and each run
walks the whole tree.

```
dot peer setup [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help                help for setup
      --interval duration   how often to sync with the peer (default 15m0s)
      --off                 remove the scheduled job
```
