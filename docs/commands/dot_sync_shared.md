## dot sync shared

Manage manual shared-folder exclusions

### Synopsis

View and manage which folders gsync skips because they are shared.

This list contains relative paths the operator added to the workspace-local
sync config. Use it for owned-but-shared-out folders that must never be
propagated through the workspace-authoritative mirror flow.

The list feeds a per-run dynamic excludes file passed to rsync.

  dot sync shared             # alias for list
  dot sync shared list
  dot sync shared add <path>...
  dot sync shared remove <path>...
  dot sync shared clear

```
dot sync shared [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for shared
```
