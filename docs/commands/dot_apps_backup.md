## dot apps backup

Snapshot macOS app settings to the backup archive

### Synopsis

Back up macOS application settings listed in the embedded manifest.

Modes:
  - positional args       : back up exactly those tokens.
  - --all                 : back up every manifest entry.
  - --select              : open the checkbox picker even when state has a list.
  - no args + interactive : open the checkbox picker. The list shows the
                            installed casks that also have a manifest entry,
                            plus any custom tokens you added previously.
                            Apps with an existing backup snapshot (or in your
                            saved selection) come pre-ticked. You can also
                            type extra tokens; each is validated against the
                            manifest before being accepted.
  - no args + --yes       : use saved state (falls back to manifest ∩ installed).
