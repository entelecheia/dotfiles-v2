## dot ws

Dual-workspace (work + cloud mirror) folder operations

### Synopsis

Operate on both the workspace root and the gsync mirror simultaneously.

Subcommands keep the two trees in structural sync:
  init       Clone configured workspace repos (recursive)
  mkdir      Create a folder on both sides
  mv         Rename/move on both sides
  rm         Remove on both sides (use --recursive for non-empty)
  audit      Report structural mismatches (read-only)
  reconcile  Interactively resolve mismatches

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for ws
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --config string    Path to custom config YAML
      --dry-run          Show what would be done without executing
      --home string      Override home directory (for admin setup of other users)
      --module strings   Run specific modules only
      --profile string   Profile name (minimal, full, server)
