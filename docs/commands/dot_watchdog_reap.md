## dot watchdog reap

Run one reaper pass (the LaunchAgent invokes this)

### Synopsis

Sample the process table once, fold it into the cross-run history, and
act on every process that matches the watchdog config, is not allowlisted,
and has held CPU at or above the threshold for at least the sustain window.
dry-run mode only logs and notifies; enforce mode sends SIGTERM, waits the
kill grace, then SIGKILLs.

```
dot watchdog reap [flags]
```

```
  -h, --help   help for reap
