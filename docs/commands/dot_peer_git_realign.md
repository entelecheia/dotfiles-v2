Move HEAD and index to the descendant commit the files already match

### Synopsis

Move each repo's HEAD and index forward to the descendant commit its files
already match. The default is a preview; --apply moves.

A repo with no such descendant is reported as no-match with a class and the
next step:
  at-tip            at the upstream tip; only uncommitted changes differ
  ahead-unpushed    local-only commits the upstream lacks; push them
  diverged          local-only commits and upstream commits; the files match
                    an upstream commit
  rewritten-upstream
                    diverged, but each local-only commit has an upstream twin
                    with the same author, date and subject: the upstream was
                    rewritten, and a rescue stays local
  branch-mismatch   HEAD is on another branch, the files match the default
                    branch
A leftover REBASE_HEAD with no rebase in progress is skipped as
stale-rebase-head with the command that clears it.

--rescue also moves diverged (rewritten-upstream included) and
branch-mismatch repos: HEAD's commits are kept on rescue/<yymmdd>-<branch>,
pushed to the remote (--no-push keeps it local; a Git LFS repo, one the
check cannot read, or one whose push remote has a rescue branch is rescued
only with --no-push; a pushed name skips those the remote's tracking refs
hold), then HEAD and the index move to the matching commit, on the default
branch for a branch mismatch. No worktree file but .gitmodules is written;
every move prints its undo command. A rescue can still fail (a push), so a
parent that can stay does not record a commit past where its rescued child
may end, and follows on the next run; a parent whose own files need the move
names in its tie line the children it passes.

A rewritten upstream (a history rewrite that kept authors, dates and
subjects, as git filter-repo does; a rebase or amend counts too) leaves the
Mac that did not rewrite with the pre-rewrite commits as local-only work.
Pushing them would publish what the rewrite took out, so rewritten-upstream
repos are rescued only with --no-push, and so is any repo with a local-only
commit that has such a twin on a remote branch (a commit made on top of the
old history, a branch cut from it, a feature branch whose upstream was
rewritten) or where that cannot be checked; the old commits stay on the
local rescue branch. Tags the rewrite moved stay at the old commits until
git fetch --tags --force.

--candidate-refs <pattern> (repeatable) also takes the commits of refs
matching a git for-each-ref pattern as candidates, in every repo, for the
case where the Mac that stopped had commits it never pushed. Fetch its
branches into a namespace first, for example
  git -C <repo> fetch <that Mac's repo URL> \
      '+refs/heads/*:refs/peer/<mac>/heads/*'
then realign with --candidate-refs refs/peer/<mac>/. Such a commit must be a
strict descendant of HEAD like every candidate, and a target taken from one
names its ref. A pattern that matches nothing adds nothing.

Peer sync never carries .gitmodules. In a repo that is aligned, realigned or
at its upstream tip, a worktree .gitmodules that is missing, or equal to an
older committed version of the commit it sits on or moves to, is reported
(missing or stale); --apply restores it from HEAD and runs
git submodule sync for the URLs it moves, in children the run may touch,
printing an undo for each origin it rewrites. A URL counts as moved when git
resolves the two spellings (insteadOf applied) differently. A submodule
whose gitlink commit is missing is reported with the
fetch (and set-url, for a moved URL) commands; --apply --fetch runs them and
retries it. With --apply --fetch a child that lacks a commit one of its
parent's tied candidates records is also fetched from its origin, once,
before those candidates are compared, so it is judged with the commit there
(a lone candidate the parent's own files require is taken without asking).

### Options

```
      --apply                        move HEAD and index (default is a dry-run preview)
      --candidate-refs stringArray   also take commits of refs matching this for-each-ref pattern as candidates (repeatable), e.g. refs/peer/<mac>/ after fetching that Mac's branches there
      --fetch                        with --apply, fetch a submodule whose gitlink commit is missing (following a moved URL) and retry it, and fetch a child before judging a candidate that records a commit it lacks
  -h, --help                         help for realign
      --no-push                      with --rescue, keep rescue branches local
      --rescue                       also move diverged and branch-mismatch repos, keeping HEAD on a pushed rescue/<date>-<branch> branch
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

      --module strings   Run specific modules only
