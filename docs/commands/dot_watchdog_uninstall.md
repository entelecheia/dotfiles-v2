## dot watchdog uninstall

Remove the watchdog reaper agent, WARP heal daemon, monit supervision, and Beszel agent plist (macOS)

### Synopsis

Unload and remove the reaper LaunchAgent, the monit agent and monitrc,
the Beszel agent LaunchAgent, and, when installed, the root WARP heal
LaunchDaemon. The secrets-managed Beszel env file
(~/.config/beszel/agent.env) is never removed. Restoring the power settings
saved by setup --headless, removing the root Screen Sharing heal helper and
its sudoers grant, and removing the state directory and logs are
interactive-only prompts that default to No; --yes never auto-confirms them.
