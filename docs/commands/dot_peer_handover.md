## dot peer handover

Hand the coordinator role to the peer (planned switch)

### Synopsis

Planned coordinator switch, run on the CURRENT coordinator with both
machines reachable:

  1. Run one complete peer sync; refuse if it holds anything back.
  2. Set the owner and the next epoch on the peer, then locally.
  3. Remove the local scheduler.
  4. On the peer, set the old baselines aside and run the first sync as an
     additive bootstrap (no baseline means no deletes can be planned, and
     right after step 1 almost nothing transfers).
  5. Install the peer's scheduler; its setup runs the peer's on_activate.
  6. Run this Mac's on_deactivate hooks, last: an app-quit may end the
     process running the handover.

A lost terminal (SIGHUP) does not stop a handover once it has started. If
one stops after step 3 anyway, finish by hand: dot peer setup --off here,
then dot peer sync and dot peer setup on the peer.

The takeover replica is not used here: right after a complete run the safest
baseline is no baseline. After the switch, realign the repos on the new
coordinator with `dot peer git realign --apply` (fetch first).
