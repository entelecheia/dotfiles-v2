## dot sync filters reset

Regenerate exclude.txt/include.txt from embedded templates (with backups)

### Synopsis

Backs up the current exclude.txt and include.txt to *.bak-<timestamp>
and rewrites them from the embedded templates. Use after upgrading dot to
pick up refreshed junk rules.

ignore.txt and allow.txt are operator-owned and are never touched. Re-add
any workspace-specific patterns from the backups to ignore.txt afterwards.
