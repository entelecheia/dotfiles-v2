## dot peer diff

List paths where this machine and the peer disagree

### Synopsis

Count where the two machines disagree. --list prints every planned action,
workspace and host paths alike, with each side's size and mtime; --json
prints the same plan as a document. The deletion counts are shown next to
max_delete, which caps each direction of the workspace and of the tracked
host paths.
