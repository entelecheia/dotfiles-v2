## dot peer doctor

Check that a peer sync would work before running one

### Synopsis

Probe everything that silently breaks a peer transfer.

Checks, and why each exists:
  local rsync    a non-login shell finds macOS openrsync before Homebrew's
                 3.x; openrsync escapes non-ASCII names in the inventory
  reachability   an offline peer must be a clean no-op, not a failure
  peer dot       the newest release among the peer's dot installs; a stale
                 build at ~/.local/bin/dot must not shadow it
  remote rsync   macOS 26 ships openrsync, which cannot receive -aHAX from a
                 3.x client — and --dry-run never surfaces it, because a dry
                 run ships no file data
  clock skew     "newer wins" is only meaningful if the clocks agree
  disk headroom  the receiving side has to hold the payload
  keychain       tokens there cannot be transferred, and cannot even be
                 verified over ssh — a reminder, not a failure

Then both machines are compared, each check with the command that fixes it
and the Mac to run it on: rsync on each side; names not in NFD (an
NFD-marked coordinator's diff and dry run stop on the other Mac's); which
machine is the coordinator and their owner epochs (a takeover's pending fence
settles at the lower epoch's next run); a scheduler only on the coordinator;
a takeover replica on the other Mac that a takeover would accept; max_delete,
propagation and filter files that differ.
