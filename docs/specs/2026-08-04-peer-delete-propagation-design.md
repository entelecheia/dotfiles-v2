# Peer delete propagation with quarantine

Status: implemented on `feat/peer-delete-propagation`
Date: 2026-08-04

Three things were learned while building it and are folded in below: the delete
pass must run before the push, not after (see "Retire tombstones"); rsync
must be told that the expected missing source args are not errors while every
remaining partial-transfer outcome fails closed (see "Delete on the peer, into
quarantine"); and turning on `propagation.delete` also arms the pre-existing
blanket `--delete-after` in the push, which has to be suppressed for ssh
targets (see "Keep the push additive").

## Problem

`dot peer sync` never propagates deletions. A file removed on one machine
comes back within one sync interval, because the peer still holds a copy and
the pull pass restores it.

Observed 2026-08-03: five files deleted and committed at 22:09:44 were back on
disk at ctime 22:14:29, carrying the peer's original mtimes. The same mechanism
had already produced a divergent duplicate of an inbox item earlier that day,
which was initially misdiagnosed as a bad commit.

This blocks any workflow whose normal course is to remove files (inbox
processing is the concrete case, since its whole job is moving material out of
`inbox/drop/` and `inbox/items/pending/`).

### Why `propagation.delete: true` alone does not fix it

The peer profile already has a `delete` knob and `propagationFlags` already
translates it into `--delete-after --max-delete=N`. Setting it to `true` is a
no-op for this problem, because of pass ordering:

| Pass | Flags | Effect on a locally deleted file |
|---|---|---|
| 1. pull (peer → local) | `--update`, no delete flags | **restores it** |
| 2. push (local → peer) | `--delete-after` | present locally again, so nothing to delete |

`pullArgs` hardcodes `--update` and never consults `cfg.Propagation`; only
`pushArgs` calls `propagationFlags`. Verified empirically: with a file present
on the peer and absent locally, pull recreates it and the subsequent push with
`--delete-after` removes nothing.

The root difficulty is that the pull pass cannot distinguish *deleted here on
purpose* from *created over there and not yet seen*. Both are "absent locally".

## What already exists

Most of the machinery is present and does not need to be built.

| Capability | Where | State |
|---|---|---|
| Deletion decision rules | `internal/syncer/push_plan.go` | Complete and safe. Absent-locally + in baseline + unchanged on target → delete; not in baseline → treated as target-side new and protected; changed after baseline → conflict, not deleted |
| Quarantine of removed files | `pushArgs` already passes `--backup --backup-dir=.sync-conflicts/<ts>/from-workspace` | Works. rsync moves deleted files into the backup dir with content and relative path preserved |
| Retention purge | `PruneConflicts` + `dot sync conflicts prune --older-than` (default 30 days) | Complete |
| Tombstone record type | `Tombstone`, `AppendTombstones`, `LoadTombstones`, per-profile `tombstones.log` | Exists, currently written only by mirror intake |
| Delete cap | `MaxDelete` config, `--max-delete` | Exists |
| Modern rsync on both ends | `RemoteRsyncPath` resolves a 3.x rsync on the peer | Exists |

`push_plan.go` cannot be reused wholesale: it calls `collectPlanInventory` on
the target tree, and an SSH peer cannot be walked locally. Its *rules* are
reused; its inventory step is not.

## Design

Five changes, all scoped to the peer profile.

### 1. Compute tombstones before the pull

```
tombstones = { rel : rel ∈ baseline ∧ rel ∉ localTree }
```

Filters apply to the local walk, so excluded paths never enter the set. This
needs only the local tree and `baseline.manifest`, no remote inventory, which
is what makes it work against an SSH peer.

The set is computed at the start of the run, before the pull mutates the tree.
That ordering is the whole point: after the pull, the evidence is gone.

Paths not in the baseline are not deletions. They are files the peer created
that this machine has not seen, and they are left alone. This is the same rule
`push_plan.go` already applies.

The set is *derived* each run rather than accumulated, so it cannot drift out
of step with the tree. Each newly seen path is also appended to the peer
profile's `tombstones.log` with its baseline fingerprint and a detection
timestamp, using the existing `Tombstone` type and `AppendTombstones`. That log
is an audit trail only; nothing in the algorithm reads it back (step 5).

### 2. Protect tombstoned paths during the pull

The tombstone set is written to a per-run filter file, the same way
`prepareRuntimeFilters` already materializes the exclude and include layers,
and that file is passed to the pull. The pull then cannot restore those paths.
Without this step, every later step is moot.

### 3. Delete on the peer, into quarantine

A dedicated pass after the pull and before the push:

```
rsync --files-from=<tombstones> --from0 --ignore-missing-args \
      --delete-missing-args \
      --backup --backup-dir=.sync-conflicts/<ts>/from-workspace \
      <staged-empty-parent-tree>/ <peer>:<path>/
```

`--delete-missing-args` removes exactly the listed paths that are missing on
the sender, and nothing else. `--from0` (NUL-delimited list) keeps Korean and
space-bearing filenames intact, which this workspace has many of.

Verified empirically. Given a tombstone list of `a/gone.txt`:

| Path on peer | In tombstone list | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `a/gone.txt` | yes | removed, quarantined at `.sync-conflicts/<ts>/from-workspace/a/gone.txt`, content and relative path intact |
| `a/peer-new.txt` | no | untouched |
| `a/shared.txt` | no | untouched |

This is preferred over `--delete-after`, which would delete every peer path
absent locally, including files the peer legitimately created.

Every path in the list is missing from the sender by construction.
`--ignore-missing-args` makes that expected condition clean while
`--delete-missing-args` turns the missing entry into the scoped receiver-side
delete request. Any remaining non-zero exit, including partial-transfer exits
23/24, is a real failure: it can mean the target removal or quarantine failed.
The run returns before push so the baseline keeps the tombstone for retry.

The sender is a private temporary tree containing only each tombstone's parent
directories. Without those parents, rsync reports the implied directories as
vanished and exits 24 even after a successful nested deletion. Using a staged
tree avoids that false partial without `--no-implied-dirs`, which could follow
a receiver-side symlink outside the workspace.

### 4. Keep the push additive

`propagation.delete` already fed `propagationFlags`, which emits
`--delete-after --max-delete=N` on the push. Turning the knob on therefore
armed that blanket delete alongside the precise pass. Against a mirror that is
the intended reading; against a peer, "every target path absent locally" is
most of the other machine's tree, including everything it created that has not
been pulled yet.

`pushArgs` now forces `Delete: false` for ssh targets, leaving removal on a
peer entirely to the pass above. The mirror keeps the blanket behavior.

Found by running against the real peer: rsync hit `--max-delete` and exited 25
having deleted nothing, so the cap alone stood between the change and an
emptied peer. The quarantine directories from that run contain only overwrite
backups, no deletions, which is how it was confirmed as a near miss rather
than an incident.

### 5. Retire tombstones

No explicit baseline surgery is needed. `Push` ends with `RefreshBaseline`,
which for an SSH target walks the *local* tree, so a path that is gone locally
drops out of the baseline on its own and stops being a tombstone from the next
run onward.

That is also why **the delete pass runs after the pull but before the push**.
If it ran after the push, `RefreshBaseline` would already have retired the key;
a delete pass that then failed would leave no tombstone, and the peer's copy
would come back on the next pull. Returning early on failure leaves the
baseline untouched, so the deletion is simply retried next run.

- Peer unreachable → baseline unchanged → tombstone recomputed next run and
  applied when the peer returns.
- Path recreated locally → no longer absent → not a tombstone. No special case,
  and its `tombstones.log` row is dropped on the next run.

**Tombstones do not expire.** An earlier draft gave them a 30-day TTL after
which the deletion would be abandoned, but abandoning it means the peer's copy
propagates back on the next sync, which is precisely the bug being fixed here.
A tombstone therefore survives until the delete pass applies it, however long
the peer stays away. The set stays bounded because it is derived from the
baseline, which is bounded by the tree.

`tombstones.log` is an audit trail, not state the algorithm reads back. It
answers "what was removed from the peer, and when" for a destructive operation
that would otherwise leave no local record.

## Safety

- **Cap.** If the tombstone count exceeds `max_delete`, abort the delete pass,
  report, and leave the tree untouched. Guards against a mount failure or a bad
  filter presenting the whole tree as deleted.
- **Quarantine, not removal.** Nothing is unlinked on the peer; files are moved
  under `.sync-conflicts/` and only removed later by the retention purge.
- **Quarantine containment.** Before the destructive pass, the receiver's
  workspace and timestamped quarantine components must be real directories,
  not symlinks or files. Otherwise the pass aborts before rsync.
- **Dry run.** `--dry-run` reports the tombstone set and the would-be
  quarantine paths without changing synchronized payloads or quarantine.
  Generated local runtime filter/list files may still be refreshed.
- **Pull is unchanged in kind.** It still never deletes locally. The new filter
  only prevents restoration.

The algorithm has no remote fingerprint inventory or distributed lock. If the
peer edit exists when the delete pass runs, the local deletion wins and the
edited copy moves into quarantine. A recreation after the pass can return on a
later cycle. Operators should avoid overlapping peer runs and review quarantine
before pruning; this is not equivalent to the changed-after-baseline conflict
rule available for a locally walkable mirror.

## Defaults

| Setting | Value | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Quarantine retention | 30 days | Matches the existing `conflicts prune` default. This is the only expiry in the design |
| Tombstone lifetime | until applied | Expiring a tombstone would resurrect the file; see "Retire tombstones" |
| `max_delete` | 100 for newly initialized peer profiles | Routine inbox clearing is tens of files; legacy/unset profiles still resolve through the general sync fallback of 1000 |
| Scope | peer profile only | The mirror profile has a single writer and does not have this problem |
| Deployment | both machines | Each Mac runs its own `com.dotfiles.peer` job with itself as owner; symmetric behavior needs the change on both |

The scope is the workspace transfer. The separate explicit host-path pass
remains additive and does not create or apply tombstones.

The peer baseline carries a machine-local target marker written only after a
successful SSH push with create and update enabled. A missing or mismatched
marker makes tombstone detection return an empty set, so a pre-feature baseline,
a baseline built under a restrictive propagation policy, or a changed target
cannot authorize deletion. The first full push bootstraps the marker.
Generic `dot sync push/pull/setup --profile=peer` entrypoints are refused;
only `dot peer sync` executes the complete tombstone transaction.

## Testing

- Unit: tombstone computation against a fixture baseline plus tree, covering
  in-baseline-and-absent (tombstone), not-in-baseline (peer-new, protected),
  filtered-out (ignored), and recreated-locally (not a tombstone).
- Unit: pull args carry the protective filter; delete-pass args carry
  `--files-from`, `--from0`, `--ignore-missing-args`,
  `--delete-missing-args`, and a backup dir.
- Unit: a partial-transfer exit from the delete pass remains fatal so push
  cannot retire an unapplied tombstone.
- Unit: tombstone count over `max_delete` aborts without invoking rsync.
- Integration: two local trees standing in for local and peer. Delete a file
  locally, run a full cycle, assert it stays deleted locally, is gone from the
  peer, is present under the peer's `.sync-conflicts/`, and that a peer-only
  file created in the same cycle survives on both sides.
- Regression: existing peer tests asserting no `--delete*` flags on the pull
  pass must still pass. The pull must remain non-deleting.
- Regression: an ssh push must carry no `--delete*` flag even with
  propagation.delete on; a local (mirror) push must still carry
  `--delete-after`.

Verified live against the real peer on 2026-08-04, with a probe file deleted
locally and a control file created only on the peer in the same cycle:

| Property | Result |
|---|---|
| Probe stays deleted locally after a full cycle | pass |
| Probe removed from the peer | pass |
| Probe quarantined on the peer with content intact | pass |
| Peer-only control file survives on the peer | pass |
| Peer-only control file still reaches this machine | pass |

## Out of scope

- Mirror (`dot sync`) delete propagation.
- Reconciling the two machines' diverged git histories, which is a separate
  open problem (local ahead 9, peer ahead 17 with uncommitted work).
- Automating the retention purge on a schedule. `dot sync conflicts prune`
  stays manual for now; revisit if quarantine accumulation becomes a nuisance.
